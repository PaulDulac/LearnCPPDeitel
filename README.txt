LearnCPPDeitel
==============

This repository contains all of the exercises that I'm doing as I
work through the "C++ - How to Program" book by Deitel and Deitel.
It should be separate folders for each chapter with the exercises
within those folders, and if I figure out the .gitignore thing, the
only thing in those folders is going to be the .cpp and .h files.
(That way I'm not spitting out multiple executables as well as the
.obj files I keep producing when I compile on Windows :)

The idea is to learn programmnig in C++ while being able to keep track
of my progress.  I remember hearing that github was a good place to 
start doing that, so here I am, learning git. 

Should be fun.
