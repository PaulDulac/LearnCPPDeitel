LICENSE AND RULES FOR THIS HERE CODE STUFF
==========================================


This code falls under the most lenient or open IP license
you prefer.  It's basically me doing self-assigned homework, and
it should be taken as such.

So BE WARNED!!!  If you want to use this code, its been written
by a noob for himself and no others.  You assume all risk for
whatever dark things may happen to your system if you try to
run it, though I'll try to not suck that hard.

BUT!!!

The problems that I'm solving are the mind-babies of Deitel and Deitel
and whomever helped them, and are not things I've come up with.  I lay
no claim to the prompts or exercises themselves, the code files here are
only my solutions to the problems they've designed.

If you're a student also working through their book for whatever reason,
feel free to look at my solutions and see how they match up to 
whatever you come up with.  Hopefully I'm producing the correct results.
But please try and complete them on your own before checking mine,
as otherwise you won't be learning anything and will more likely than
not just pick up my bad habits.
