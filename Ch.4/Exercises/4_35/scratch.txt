// terrible encryption scheme
all data transmitted as four-digit integers.

Write two programs

1)  Encrypter
- read a four digit integer entered by user
- replace each digit w/ result of adding 7 and getting the remainder after dividing the new value by 10.
- then swap first digit with third, and second digit with fourth
- then print the newly encrypted integer

2)  Decrypter
- read an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypt it
- print the original number.


for 1) - 
read all 4 digits at once.
separate digits using div and mod, store in individual variables
add 7 and find remainder for each variable
print << third << fourth << first << second

read all 4 digits at once

0-7
1-8
2-9
3-0
4-1
add three and find mod 10 (remainder)
print << third << fourth << first << second
